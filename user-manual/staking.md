# Staking Guide

Staking can be accomplished by calling the `stake` method of the Ribose system contract. You can find more information in the contract [source code](https://github.com/genechain-io/system-contract/blob/master/contracts/Ribose.sol).

A simpler way is to use the [staking page](https://staking.genechain.io). The staking page for Adenine testnet is [here](https://staking-testnet.genechain.io).

Here is a simple guide on how to use the staking page.

## Navigate to the staking page

Open the [staking page](https://staking.genechain.io).

1. If Metamask is not installed, click the `Click here to install MetaMask` button or follow the steps in \[\[Metamask\]\] to install one.

2. If GeneChain Adenine Testnet is not configured, a prompt will be shown. 
   1. Click the `Add GeneChain network` button to inform MetaMask of adding GeneChain network.

## Authorize the staking page

You need to authorize the staking page to use your account to interact with the Ribose system contract.

This is automatically prompted the first time you open the staking page. Just select the account you want to use and click `Next`.

Note: 1. You can stake either RNA or ARM or both. You can stake with out ARM, but if you want to, you need to stake at least 3 ARMs. 2. If you want to stake your ARM, you need to approve the Ribose system contract to use your ARM by clicking the `Approve` next to the ARM input while staking. 3. You can not unstake within 86400 blocks which is about 72 hours since your last staking.

## Withdraw mining rewards

After staking a candidate, you'll find your unsettled profit and estimated daily reward in `Staked Candidates` section. You can settle your unsettled reward one by one or just click `Settle All Unsettled Rewards`. Then you will find your settled profit on right side, and you can click `Withdraw` bellow to withdraw you settled profit into your balance.
